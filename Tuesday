Define the Maintenance Tasks and Costs:

Each maintenance task is stored in a dictionary, with its cost and frequency (number of times per year).
Function to Calculate Annual Cost:

The calculate_annual_cost function iterates through the tasks and calculates the annual cost for each task by multiplying its cost by its frequency.
The total annual cost is then returned.
Calculate and Print Costs:

The script calculates the total annual maintenance cost.
It also calculates and prints the equivalent monthly, weekly, and daily costs for better budget management.
Usage:
Simply run the script, and it will print out the maintenance costs for each task, along with the total annual, monthly, weekly, and daily costs.

Feel free to modify the maintenance_tasks dictionary to include additional tasks or adjust the costs and frequencies as needed for your specific facility.
